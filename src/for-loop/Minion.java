/*
 * Minion.java
 *
 * You met a minion who is banana for fruits (no puns intended...)! Ask them for 
 * their name and they will yell a kind of fruit x times, where x is a random 
 * number between 1 and 20. But if you ended up asking Gru what his favorite 
 * fruit, he would say, "I don't like fruits!".
 * 
 *  
 * 1. Ask your minion what their name is? (hint: use JOptionPane)
 * 2. Ask your minion what their favorite fruit is?
 * 3. Get a number between 1 and 20.
 * 4. Make the minion go crazy and say their favorite fruit names over and over!
 * 5. But remember that Gru doesn't like fruits!
